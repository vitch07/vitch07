# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning classification algorithms to predict whether a breast tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on diagnostic features. The model is trained and evaluated on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, aiming to assist in early detection and diagnosis.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a reliable ML-based classification model that can help in predicting the presence of breast cancer using medical diagnostic data.
